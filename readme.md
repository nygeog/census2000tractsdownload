census2000tractsdownload
========================

This python script will download all of the US 2000 Census Tracts shapefile zip files to one folder, extract the shapefiles and then delete the zip files.

I'm currently updating this to do the detailed geographies for 2000 and 2010 tract boundaries. Also, I will include the full download for the removal of the water (areawater) features.
